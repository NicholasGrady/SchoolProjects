<h1>School projects using Wireshark, Nmap, and Autopsy</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I chose to upload 2 projects from one of the courses that I found enjoyable while doing my Bachelors degree at WGU in cybersecurity.  The 2 projects for my class were during the month of June in 2023.  One of the projects consists of using Nmap and wireshark to find vulnerabilities on the network.  The second projects consists of using a forensic tool, Autopsy.  These projects are documentation of me using the tools and documenting down my findings and steps towards those findings.

<h2>Nmap + Wireshark</h2>
For this project, I use Zenmap to identify vulnerabilities within a network of 6 computers such as weak protocols being used as well as utilitizing Mitre's Common Vulnernabilitiy and Exposures (CVE) to find vulnerable software that is being used on computers in the network.  The second part of this project is using a Pcap file in Wireshark where I identify some of the traffic from this 6 computer network.  Vulnerabilities found from Wireshark show several weak protocols being used and a threat actor from an IP address not in the network that created an account and password to log into the FTP server. 

The documentation I created for this project can be seen with screenshots in the Autopsy PDF attached, or by clicking [Here](https://github.com/NicholasGrady/SchoolProjects/blob/main/Grady%20-%20Nmap%20and%20Wireshark.pdf).  References I used to come to my conclusions are also listed.

<h2>Autopsy</h2>
An introductory to forensics project using the Autopsy tool to inspect an image of a employees computer.  Little information was given about what would be uncovered during this project but I was given AUP and NDA policies that applied to the employee.  Upon using the tool it is fairly clear that the documents found and saved on the employees computer breached the companies NDA that the employee signed as the employee was selling proprietary information.
