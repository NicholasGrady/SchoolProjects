<h1>School projects using Wireshark, Nmap, and Autopsy</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was done during my coursework during my Bachelor's degree at WGU in cybersecurity. These 2 projects were for one of my classes during June 2023. One of the projects consists of using Nmap and Wireshark to find vulnerabilities in the network. The second project used a forensic tool, Autopsy. These projects are my documentation of using specific tools and documenting my findings and the steps towards those findings.

<h2>Nmap + Wireshark</h2>
For this project, I used Zenmap to identify vulnerabilities within a network of 6 computers such as weak protocols, and utilizing Mitre's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) to find vulnerable software being used on computers in the network. The second part of this project is using a Pcap file in Wireshark where I identify some of the traffic from this 6 computer network. Vulnerabilities found from Wireshark show several weak protocols being used and a threat actor from an IP address not in the network that created an account and password to log into the FTP server.

<h2>Autopsy</h2>
An introductory forensics project using the Autopsy tool to inspect an image of an employee's computer from the network. Little information was given about what would be uncovered during this project but I was given AUP and NDA policies that applied to the employee. Upon using the tool it is fairly clear that the documents found and saved on the employee's computer breached the company's NDA that the employee signed as the employee was selling proprietary information.
